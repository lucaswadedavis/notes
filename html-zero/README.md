# Notes on HTML Zero

Complexity is my enemy.

I want a front-end that is modular, clear, and simple, a front-end that plays well with tools other people have written.

I like pure functions.

I understand closures.

I want to eschew other languages, HTML, CSS, and DSLs like JSX, Angular, and templating languages like Jade or Handlebars.

I'm willing to lose some features (life-cycle hooks I will miss for example) for the sake of modularity and simplicity.
