# Notes on HTML Zero

Complexity is my enemy.

I want a front-end that is modular, clear, and simple, a front-end that plays well with tools other people have written.

I like pure functions.

I understand closures.

I want to eschew other languages, HTML, CSS, and DSLs like JSX, Angular, and templating languages like Jade or Handlebars.

I'm willing to lose some features (life-cycle hooks I will miss for example) for the sake of modularity and simplicity.

Critiques:
 - It looks old. Developers accustomed to JSX and using Babel for ESLatest features may be biased against vanilla JS (though there's absolutely nothing wrong with using ESLatest with HTML Zero
 - No Life cycle hooks
 - No HTML templating means Designers who only know HTML and CSS are at a disadvantage (I think this is incorrect, and dress and append are good abstractions)
 - No CSS (use something like Dress and the designers can use everything they know).
