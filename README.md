Howey Hubler - The $9b Loser Millionaire


What do I want?
- Simplicity (Favor Simple Logic and Complex Data over Simple Data and Complex Logic)
- Modularity (Components should be unitary - I shouldn't need to go to 3 files to figure out what is going on)
- No Templates, No HTML, No CSS
- Enthalpy (Least Surprise)
- Composeability
- Interoperability (can I use lots of other tools with this)
- (Optional) Lifecycle hooks (I worry that this reduces Simplicity and interoperability)
- Clarity
- Parsimony
- Transparency (JSON not Strings)
- Flexibility
- Extensibility
- Every program is a filter (Correlary: keep data data as long as possible, only create DOM at the last moment)
- I want to work in the lab not the factory
